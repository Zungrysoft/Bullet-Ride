Maps:
-----
The Dredge Arena:
This is the map that was in the previous version. This version is full of tune-ups, improvements to the gameplay, and two exciting new features! This level centers around melee combat and puzzle-solving.

Balt Ghadlef:
A horror medieval level, just in time for halloween! This level only has one rune so far, but I wanted to get some testing on the level's unique mechanic.

Crimson Consequence:
An updated version of my sm195 map, this wide open dungeon has plenty of space to explore for runes.

Hellbent:
Are you ready to fulfill Satan's Quota? This experimental map has you going from room to room to complete patterns, with a WarioWare-esque challenge at the end! The texures are from Freedoom.

A Paltry Sum:
This was a random map I made in a few hours as a test of what you can do with vanilla func_doors. I might release this as a standalone vanilla map at some point.

Silth Gunnet:
An industrial base with ten runes to find! Will you take the Grenade Launcher or Super Nailgun? It's your choice every time. The final rune is quite difficult to find. I'm curious if anyone will get it. The textures are from Oblivion.

New Weapons:
------------
Railgun - This long-ranged rifle from Quake 2 does heavy damage and pierces enemies!
Flamethrower - This particle-based weapon will keep enemies from getting anywhere near you! Hitting enemies at close range deals more damage.
